Supplementary materials for the manuscript: “In Vivo Mapping of Rat Brain Partial White Matter Content Using Hexachlorophene-induced Neurotoxicity Model”.

1. Files ‘Anatomical_template.mhd/Anatomical_template.raw’ are the skull-stripped image of the rat brain used as a co-registration template in the manuscript. It is in a .mhd format, which could be opened using many image analysis software packages like ImageJ or Analyze and is standard for ITK library. It also can be opened as a raw data (file ‘Anatomical_template.raw’) using appropriate software (like ImageJ) with the following parameters: data matrix is 192 x 192 x 24, data type is 32-bit real, big endian. 

2. File ‘WM_map.mhd/WM_map.raw’ is the partial white matter map of the rat brain co-registered with the template brain image described above. The data format is the same as above. The values in each voxel of this map represents the partial content of white matter (in %) in that voxel.
